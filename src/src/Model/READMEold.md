# Bike Energy Model

This model simulates the energy consumption of cyclists over a given road segment using GPX track data. The simulation accounts for slope, wind resistance, rolling resistance, acceleration/deceleration, and environmental conditions. It is adapted from a MATLAB model, built by Malte RothhÃ¤mel, and fully rewritten and modularized in Python.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: A GPX file describing a cycling route.
2. **Map Processing**: Elevation and curvature data are extracted and converted to slope, step distances, etc.
3. **Simulation**: The cyclist model is simulated with power constraints, speed limits, and environmental factors.
4. **Output**: Energy, time, speed, and distance results for different cyclist types (women/men).

## Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

Or for development:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Make sure your Python version is >= 3.8.

## â–¶Running the Model

Use the CLI tool:

```bash
python run.py
```

To save the output as JSON:

```bash
python run.py -o output.json
```

## Output

The simulation prints and plots:
- Histograms and boxplots of energy, time, distance, and speed.
- Summary statistics for both women and men cyclist populations.

## Configuration

The simulation behavior is controlled via `params.yaml`. Here you can customize:
- Physical constants (e.g., gravity, air density)
- Cyclist VO2max data
- Weight distributions
- Rolling resistance and temperature effects
- Aerodynamic drag values
- Max slope clipping and GPX file path

## Example GPX File

Place your GPX file in the `data/raw/` directory and reference its name in `params.yaml`:
```yaml
map:
  gpx_folder: data/raw
  gpx_file: YourTrackFile.gpx
```
